# Discord Buttons Rich Presence
Howdy, looks like you want to be able to have BUTTONS on your Discord Rich Presance.
Great! You've found it :D

# Instalation:
1. Download the folder :D
2. Open it somewhere where you'd like and remember. (I suggest the Desktop)
3. Navigate to the foler in your command prompt and do the next commands:
``npm i``  
``node index.js``  

Now you might wonder why my logo and buttons show up. That's where the Config.JSON file comes up.

## Configuring the CONFIG.JSON File

Open the config.json file and edit to your needs. Here is what each one means:  

```appid = Is the application ID, make one here https://discord.com/developers/applications

pic = Is the picture you would like to show. Update this is the Rich Presance portion on the Application you just made.

pictext = Is the text you would like to show when hovering over the Picture above

text = Is the text that will show on your Profile under what the Application is called.

button1text = The text that will go in the First Button
button1link = The link Button1 will redirect to when clicked

button2text = The text that will go in the Second Button
button2link = The link Button2 will redirect to when clicked
```
If you would like to know what it looks like first check out this picture:

(YOU CAN NOT CLICK THE BUTTONS ON YOUR PROFILE BUT OTHERS CAN... DO NOT THINK IT IS BROKEN IF YOU CANT CLICK THEM.)
AGAIN YOU CANT CLICK BUTTONS ON YOUR OWN PROFILE. THEY WILL NOT WORK

This is from https://youtu.be/NJxSb2cvRG8 | But I made a config file to make it a bit more user friendly to be able to configure easier for people.

Thanks :D
